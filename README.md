Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding datasets by summarizing their main characteristics and visualizing them. This project demonstrates how to perform EDA using a car dataset from Kaggle.

What is EDA?
EDA involves visualizing data through plots like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots. It helps in defining problem statements and preparing data for modeling.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains over 10,000 rows and more than 10 columns with features such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG, and more.
