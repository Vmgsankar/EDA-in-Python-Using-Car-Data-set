## Project Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science project. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often visualizing them. This project covers the following key steps:
- Loading the data
- Cleaning the data
- Visualizing the data
- Statistical analysis

The notebook provided walks through these steps using a sample dataset.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
